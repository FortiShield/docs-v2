# Fee Sharing

egiftcard collects a 1% fee per end user transaction. We share 30% of this fee with you.

For example, if a user purchases $100 worth of Polygon through your application, egiftcard charges a total of $1.00. egiftcard collects $0.70 and sends $0.30 to you.

To participate in fee sharing, all you need to do is set a recipient address in your dashboard. Your recipient address can be configured in your dashboard by navigating to [Connect > Pay](https://www.egiftcard.cc/dashboard/connect/pay).
