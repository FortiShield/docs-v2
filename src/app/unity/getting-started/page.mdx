# Getting Started

<Callout variant='info' title="Recommendation">

We recommend using an API key to use egiftcard’s default infrastructure services with the SDK such as RPC, Storage and Account Abstraction. If you haven’t created a key yet you can do so for free from the [egiftcard dashboard](https://egiftcard.cc/create-api-key).

</Callout>

To get started, you'll need to [download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor](https://unity.com/download).

We recommend using the 2022 LTS version of Unity.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Unity Package Download" >

Download the latest egiftcard Unity SDK package from the [releases page](https://github.com/egiftcard/unity-sdk/releases).

</Step>

<Step title="Unity Package Import" >

Drag and drop the package into your Unity project. Feel free to deselect common packages like Newtonsoft if you already have them.

</Step>

<Step title="Test it!" >

Play around in our example `Scene_Prefabs` to test out the SDK!

<DocImage src={prefabScene} />

</Step>

<Step title="Build it!" >

Refer to the [Build Settings](https://github.com/egiftcard/unity-sdk#build), pick a target platform and build your scene!

We support all platforms.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Egiftcard Manager

Now you're ready to use the SDK in your own scene!

The only requirement is to have a [EgiftcardManager](/unity/egiftcardmanager) prefab present in your scene.

Navigate to `Egiftcard` > `Core` > `Prefabs` > `EgiftcardManager` drag it into your scene.

Alternatively, use our handy quickstart installer from the top level `Tools > Egiftcard` menu.

<DocImage src={sdkInstaller} className="w-96" />

<Callout variant='info' title="How It Works">

The [EgiftcardManager](/unity/egiftcardmanager) represents your Egiftcard SDK singleton, providing a convenient interface for setting up and controlling SDK parameters directly from inspector.

Access the SDK from anywhere in your code using `EgiftcardManager.Instance.SDK`.
