});

# Getting Started

<Callout variant='info' title="Recommendation">

We recommend using an API key to use egiftcard’s default infrastructure services with the .NET SDK such as RPC, Storage, and Account Abstraction. If you haven’t created a key yet, you can do so for free from the [egiftcard dashboard](https://egiftcard.cc/create-api-key).

</Callout>

To get started with the Egiftcard .NET SDK, ensure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

We recommend using the latest stable version of .NET.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title=".NET Package Installation" >

Install the Egiftcard .NET SDK via NuGet package manager:

```bash
dotnet add package Egiftcard
```

This command adds the Egiftcard SDK to your project, allowing you to interact with the blockchain in your .NET applications.

</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Egiftcard Client" >

Create a new instance of the Egiftcard client in your application:

```csharp
// For Frontend Applications
var client = EgiftcardClient.Create(clientId: "yourClientId", bundleId: "yourBundleId");

// For Backend Applications
var client = EgiftcardClient.Create(secretKey: "yourSecretKey");
```

Replace "yourClientId" and "yourBundleId" with your actual client ID and bundle ID. Note that a bundle ID is only required if you are not using the SDK from a web application.

</Step>
<Step title="Interact with Smart Contracts" >

Now, you can start interacting with smart contracts. For example, to read from a contract:

```csharp
var contract = await EgiftcardContract.Create(client: client, address: "contractAddress", chain: chainId);
var readResult = await EgiftcardContract.Read<string>(contract, "methodName");
Console.WriteLine($"Contract read result: {readResult}");
```

Replace "contractAddress", chainId, and "methodName" with your contract's address, the chain ID, and the method name you wish to call.

</Step>
<Step title="Explore Advanced Features" >

Check the SDK documentation for more advanced features like interacting with smart wallets, signing messages, and performing transactions.
