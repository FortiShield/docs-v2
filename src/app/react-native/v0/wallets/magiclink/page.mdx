# Magic Link

<Callout variant="warning" title='Deprecated'>

This wallet is deprecated. Please use [In-App Wallet](/react-native/v0/wallets/embedded-wallet) instead for adding Social Login to your app.

</Callout>

#### Add Magic's dependencies

The `@magic-sdk` has a few dependencies you need to add to your app before using the SDK in React Native. For convenience you can run:

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i react-native-safe-area-context@4.5.3 react-native-webview react-native-device-info"
	yarn="yarn add react-native-safe-area-context@4.5.3 react-native-webview react-native-device-info"
	pnpm="pnpm i react-native-safe-area-context@4.5.3 react-native-webview react-native-device-info"
/>

which will install the following dependencies:

- [react-native-safe-area-context](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-safe-area-context?ref=blog.egiftcard.cc)
  - **Note**: The magic wallet requires the app to be wrapped in a `SafeAreaProvider`. This is something we handle in the SDK so please, if your app already has a `SafeAreaProvider` you can remove it and just wrap your app in our `EgiftcardProvider`, this will take care of the safe area context for you.
- [react-native-webview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-webview?ref=blog.egiftcard.cc)
- [react-native-device-info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-device-info?ref=blog.egiftcard.cc)

You also need a [Magic api-key](https://dashboard.magic.link/signup?ref=blog.egiftcard.cc) to pass it as part of the wallet config.

#### Using the new wallet

**NOTE**: `magicWallet` has been deprecated starting in version `@egiftcard/react-native@0.2.49` in favor of `magicLink` for consistency with our React SDK.

We suggest you add `magicLink` as the first wallet in your `supportedWallets` list since the UI for it is a TextInput field:

```tsx
import { Goerli } from "@egiftcard/chains";
import {
	EgiftcardProvider,
	magicLink,
	metamaskWallet,
} from "@egiftcard/react-native";

function AppWithProviders() {
	return (
		<EgiftcardProvider
			clientId="your-client-id"
			activeChain={Goerli}
			supportedWallets={[
				magicLink({
					apiKey: "magic_api_key",
				}),
				metamaskWallet(),
			]}
		>
			<App />
		</EgiftcardProvider>
	);
}
```
