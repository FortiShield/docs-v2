Specify whether to show a "Switch Network" button after the wallet is connected and it is not connected to the activeChain set in [EgiftcardProvider](/react-native/v0/EgiftcardProvider) to encourage the user to switch to the correct network in their wallet.

activeChain must be explicitly set in [EgiftcardProvider](/react-native/v0/EgiftcardProvider) for this to work.

default is `false`.

```jsx
<ConnectWallet switchToActiveChain={true} />
```
